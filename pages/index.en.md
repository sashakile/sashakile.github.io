I'm curious person that enjoys using computer systems to solve problems.

Through out the years I've changed many times my interest and perspectives on life and the world, but there are some things that I found valuable.

As a kid I played a few videogames, mainly RPGs like Pokemon or Golden Sun and in them I learned that 
you can overcome hard challenges by training with simpler challenges until they become trivial. Also played a lot of Megaman X where I learned that there are some tools or abilities that make different challenges so much more easy. So I spend most of my time learning from others how to solve problems and learning about a variety of topics from engineering, science and philosophy. 

I don't have any interest in becoming an expert on any topic but I like to deepen my understanding as I need it.

I once hoped for Nature to be deterministic but now I like to think in terms of posibilites and embrace randomness.

I enjoy reading things that I don't understand and that make me think about how I relate with the world.

I always think that "The Maze was not meant for me (nor you)"
